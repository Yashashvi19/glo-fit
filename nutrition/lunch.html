                <h1>2. PANEER AND CAULIFLOWER</h1>
                <img class="img" src="lunch2.jpg">
                <h2>METHOD:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Position an oven rack in the bottom of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
                    <li>Remove the leaves from 2 cauliflower, then trim the stem flush with the bottom of the head so the cauliflower sits flat on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Rub the outside of each head with 1 clove and cut garlic.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together the oil, 3 tablespoons mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Put the cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet and brush the entire outside and inside with the mustard-oil mixture.</li>
                    <li>Roast the cauliflower until nicely charred and tender (a long skewer inserted in the centre of the cauliflower should pass through easily), 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let rest for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup of parsley and ¼ cup of shredded paneer in a small bowl. Brush the outside of the roasted cauliflower heads all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon mustard and generously sprinkle with the Parmesan mixture.</li>

                <img class="img" src="lunch3.jpg">
                <h2>METHOD:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cut 2 tomatoes into 8 segments each lengthwise.</li>
                    <li>Mix 2 tsp of yogurt, 2 tsp salt, a pinch of  pepper, 1 tsp honey and 2 tsp vinegar and blend well together.</li>
                    <li>Keep the vegetables (2 carrots, 1 capsicum and 2 cups of shredded cabbage) and the dressing refrigerated separately until ready to serve.</li>
                    <li>When ready to serve, mix the vegetables and the dressing together.</li>
                    <li>This has to be done at the last minute, as the vegetables combined with the salt tend to shed their juices and thus become limp and soggy if kept too long.</li>
