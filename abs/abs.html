            <li><h2>Oblique Crunches</h2>
                <p>The oblique crunch fully engages the abdominal wall and the obliques, and helps to sculpt the waist. This exercise strengthens the back, tightens the core, tones the abs, and improves balance and flexibility.</p>
            </li>
                <li><h2>Side Leg Raise</h2>
                    <p>Side leg raises can be used as a warming-up exercise or you can perform it either when you do not feel like doing other workouts. It strengthens and builds up the hip muscles, helping them to look bigger, and gives a more defined appearance. This exercise is beneficial as it enhances posture, flexibility, balance and limb speed. It involves many groups of muscles of your lower body: side hip flexors, thighs, glutes, hamstrings, calves and obliques as well.</p>
                </li>

                </li>
                
                <li><h2>Plank Hip Dips</h2>
                    <p>The plank hip dips is a modified version of the elbow plank with an additional hip rotation, that further engages your core. This exercise strengthens your abs, obliques and lower back, and helps to trim down your waist.</p>
