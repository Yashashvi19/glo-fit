Just make sure to keep it clean and give it a good soapy scrub a few times a week! </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cucumber Juice + Lemon Juice</h3>

            <li><h3>Moisturizing daily</h3>
                <p>The idea of moisturizing oily skin may be counterintuitive. However, it can help to reduce pore enlargement.<br>Although moisturizing cleansers may clog the pores, in contrast, moisturizing lotions used after washing and patting the skin dry are beneficial.<br>This is because moisturizers hydrate and soften the skin. This allows the sebum to penetrate deeper into the skin, rather than sit in the pores on the surface.<br>In this way, moisturizing prevents pores becoming clogged with oil, reducing their appearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Applying a Clay Mask</h3>
                    <p>Using a clay mask once or twice a week can help to remove oil from the pores. This can prevent them from becoming enlarged, and reduce their appearance.<br>However, it is a good idea to do this on a different day to exfoliating. Over-treating the skin may cause irritation. When the skin gets irritated, pores may appear enlarged and blemishes may occur.</p>
