            <li><h2>Squats</h2>
                <p>The squat is a dynamic strength training exercise that requires several muscles in your upper and lower body to work together simultaneously.<br>Many of these muscles help power you through daily tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, bending, or carrying heavy loads. They also help you perform athletic-related activities.<br>Adding squats to your workouts can help boost your exercise performance, decrease your risk of injury, and keep you moving more easily throughout the day. But these are just a few of the benefits.</p>
            </li>
                <li><h2>Lunges</h2>
                    <p>A proper lunge posture can help you achieve a stronger and more stable core. This workout engages your core and abdominal muscles. It helps you build stability which when you move your hips up and down. A stronger core allows you deal with lower back pain and improves your balance and posture as well.</p>

            <li><h2>Raised Piles Calves</h2>
            <p>The pile squat with calf raises is a great exercise to strengthen your legs and glutes. This exercise targets the muscles on the back of the lower legs, your calves, but due to the pile squat position you're in, it also strengthens your glutes and inner thighs.</p> </li>
            
            <li><h2>Calves Raises</h2>
            <p>This move is great for improving ankle stability, strength, and subsequently overall balance. That's beneficial if you do a lot of explosive movements like jumping, since your ankle is what stabilizes your leg when you land. Ankle support is also crucial for heavy lower body lifts.</p>
